Swift Example Readme - 9/5/14

The XCode project really just exists to make sure the snippets run correctly.
The actual snippets are in the folder named "Swift Snippets" which should be
in the top level of the project folder.

I have created examples for the tutorial page and all of the object pages.
Creating the rest should just be a matter of copying, pasting, and tweaking
the examples that have been created so far.

Our library actually plays suprisingly well with Swift, it just takes some
getting used to.

Anything that returns an id would be well-served to return something with a
specific type instead if possible. Swift likes certainty in types, and it would
be helpful to not have to explicitly cast so many things into types.

I have updated the example car we use to be a Tesla. I figured it was more fun
and relevant.
